# Installation

The entire directory can simply be copied somewhere web-accessible.  For example, if you copied it to `/var/www/contagion`, you might be able to access it at `http://localhost/contagion/`.  Other than that, you just need to have JavaScript turned on in your browser.

# Usage

To see a demo of Contagion in action, visit http://contagion.rosborough.ca/

In the current version, the "Simulation Settings" form is populated with default values found in the file `javascripts/contagion.js`.  Changing the settings will change the parameters on which the simulation operates.  To run the simulation, simply click on the "Start Simulation" button.

At this point, that's pretty much all there is to it!
